        question: "1. What is Training Compensation?",
        answer: "Training Compensation is a mechanism established by FIFA to ensure that clubs that invest in the training and education of young players are rewarded. It is payable when a player signs their first contract as a professional and on each subsequent transfer until the end of the season of their 23rd birthday."
    },
    {
        question: "2. What are Solidarity Payments?",
        answer: "Solidarity Payments are a separate mechanism where a percentage (5%) of any transfer fee for a professional player is distributed to the clubs that contributed to the player's training between the ages of 12 and 23. This applies to transfers that occur before the expiration of a player's contract."
    },
    {
        question: "3. What is the difference between Training Compensation and Solidarity Payments?",
        answer: "Training Compensation is based on fixed training costs set by FIFA and is paid when a player turns professional or transfers up to age 23. Solidarity Payments are a percentage of the transfer fee (5%) and are paid whenever a player is transferred for a fee during their contract, regardless of age (as long as they were trained between 12-23)."
    },
    {
        question: "4. Do these regulations apply to U.S. clubs and academies?",
        answer: "Yes. In 2019, the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) Professional League Standards were updated to acknowledge FIFA's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (RSTP). U.S. youth clubs and academies are entitled to receive Training Compensation and Solidarity Payments for players who sign professional contracts internationally."
    },
    {
        question: "5. Who pays the Training Compensation?",
        answer: "The new club that registers the player as a professional is responsible for paying the Training Compensation to every club that contributed to the player's training."
    },
    {
        question: "6. How is Training Compensation calculated?",
        answer: "It is calculated by multiplying the number of years of training (from age 12 to 21) by the 'indicative amount' set by FIFA for the category of the new club. The costs are intended to reflect the average cost of training a player in that region."
    },
    {
        question: "7. How are Solidarity Payments calculated?",
        answer: "Solidarity Payments are calculated as 5% of the total transfer fee. This 5% is then divided among the training clubs based on the number of years the player spent at each club between the ages of 12 and 23."
    },
    {
        question: "8. What are the specific percentages for Solidarity Payments per year?",
        answer: "For the seasons of the player's 12th to 15th birthdays, the club receives 0.25% of the total transfer fee per year. For the seasons of the 16th to 23rd birthdays, the club receives 0.5% per year."
    },
    {
        question: "9. Does Training Compensation apply to domestic transfers in the U.S.?",
        answer: "Generally, FIFA's Training Compensation rules apply to international transfers. Domestic transfers are governed by national regulations. In the U.S., MLS and USL have their own rules, but the FIFA system is primarily triggered when a player moves internationally."
    },
    {
        question: "10. What is a 'Player Passport'?",
        answer: "A Player Passport is a document that lists all the clubs a player has been registered with since the age of 12. It is essential for calculating and verifying claims for Training Compensation and Solidarity Payments."
    },
    {
        question: "11. How can an academy claim these payments?",
        answer: "Academies must track their former players. When a player signs a professional contract or is transferred internationally, the academy should submit a claim through the FIFA Clearing House or relevant governing body, providing proof of the player's registration history."
    },
    {
        question: "12. What is the FIFA Clearing House?",
        answer: "The FIFA Clearing House is a centralized entity established to automate the distribution of training rewards (Training Compensation and Solidarity Payments) to ensure transparency and that money reaches the training clubs."
    },
    {
        question: "13. Are pay-to-play clubs eligible?",
        answer: "Yes, any club affiliated with the national association (USSF) that contributed to the player's training is eligible, regardless of their business model (pay-to-play or free-to-play)."
    },
    {
        question: "14. What happens if a link in the player's history cannot be found?",
        answer: "If a training club cannot be identified or does not exist anymore, the portion of the payments due to that club generally goes to the national association of the country where the training took place, to be used for youth development programs."
    },
    {
        question: "15. Is there a time limit to claim payments?",
        answer: "Yes, under FIFA regulations, claims must generally be brought within two years of the event giving rise to the dispute (i.e., the registration or transfer date)."
    },
    {
        question: "16. Can a club waive its right to Training Compensation?",
        answer: "Yes, a club can waive its entitlement to Training Compensation, but this must be done explicitly in writing. It is often a point of negotiation in player contracts."
    },
    {
        question: "17. Why are these payments important for U.S. academies?",
        answer: "They provide a crucial revenue stream that rewards successful player development. This income can be reinvested into the academy to improve facilities, coaching, and scholarships, ultimately raising the standard of soccer in the United States."
