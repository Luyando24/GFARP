# **Project Plan**

**Project Title:** Global Football Academy Registration Platform  
**Prepared by:** Luyando Chikandula – Spaceminds Agency  
**Date:** 16 Oct 2025  
**Timeline:** 21 Days from Contract Signing

## **1\. Project Overview**

This project involves building a **web-based platform** that enables **football academies worldwide** to register their institutions and players with **official FIFA systems** such as *FIFA Connect*, *Training Compensation*, and *Solidarity Mechanism*.

The platform’s purpose is to **simplify, digitize, and automate** the FIFA registration process for academies that currently lack access or knowledge to register correctly—helping them secure future financial rights when their players become professionals.

The key selling point of the platform is its **simplicity and intuitive user interface (UI/UX)** — making complex FIFA registration procedures effortless for academies.

## **2\. Project Objectives**

1. Develop a **secure, scalable, and user-friendly** web platform for football academies to:

   * Manage player records

   * Upload official documents

   * Track subscription usage

   * Comply with FIFA registration standards

2. Implement **subscription-based access control** (Basic, Pro, Elite) with data and storage limits.

3. Build an **admin system** to manage users, payments, and data compliance.

4. Design a **clean, modern, FIFA-like UI** that feels trustworthy and globally accessible.

## **3\. Target Users**

* Football academies and youth clubs

* Player development programs

* Licensed FIFA agents and consultants

**Primary regions:** Africa, Middle East, and South America.
